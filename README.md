# Introduction  
This repository contains all supplementary material, data and scripts to perform anaylses for Garlovsky, M. D., Caroline Evans, Mathew A. Rosenow, Timothy L. Karr and Rhonda R. Snook "Seminal fluid protein divergence among populations exhibiting postmating prezygotic reproductive isolation". The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the [ProteomeXchange consortium](http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org) via the PRIDE partner repository (Vizca√≠no et al. 2016) with the dataset identifier PXD019634. The unfiltered *proteinGroups.txt* file exported from MaxQuant has been submitted to [Dryad](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.pvmcvdnhw). 

### Contents:
* statistical_analysis.R: This script performs all statistical analyses.

* DmonSfps.csv: List of  seminal fluid proteins (Sfps) identified.

* MaxQuant_proteingroups.csv: *proteinGroups* (.txt) file exported from MaxQuant and appended with identifiers from Parker et al. (2018) and FlyBase.org.  

* omega_data.csv: Results of PAML analysis.  

* up_in_tissue.csv: IDs for proteins found with concordant higher abundance in the accessory gland proteomoe or ejaculatory duct/bulb proteome
